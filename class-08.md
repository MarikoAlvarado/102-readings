### Building Blocks

- HTML automates each *element* as being within it's own box.

- The box = block-level box **OR** inline box

- If a block-level element is *within* another block-level element. The outer becomes the **containing** or **parent** element.

### Control Positions of Elements

- **normal flow** *static*

- **positioning** or **float**

- **relative positioning** *offset properties* to move from where it would have been in *normal flow*

- **absolute positioning** *the box* will not affect elements

- **fixed positioning** *specific* elements can be fixed on the page so they do not move.

**z-index** can be used to keep elements from overlapping

get *side by side elements* using **float**

keep *elements clear/with space* between one another using **float-left,float-right** etc

### multi-column layout

use **width, float** and **margin**

### Fixed Width Layouts and Liquid Layouts

- **fixed** will not change size as browser window size changes

- **liquid** will stretch and shrink to fit as browser window size changes

**grid layout examples** on **pages 389-390**

**stay organized by using separate style sheets to group similar types of styling using *@import* or *a link*. the last rule will take precedence**

### What Does a Function Do?

- you can group a series of statements in order to perform a task

- you can reuse the same functino in different parts of a script rather that repeating the same statement

- functions let you store which steps are needed to perform a task

- functions must be given a **name** so that when you *call* the function it knows it's task

- Steps for a funciton are in a code block *{'stepsoffunctionhere}*

**A BASIC FUNCTION** holds the statements until the function is called for

**Declaring a function** 

- simply declare function by starting with it the *function* keyword followed by the function name

- remember to enclose the code block using *curly braces {}*

- the function can be called later throughout code by writing *functionName* follow this by parenthesis and the semi colon.

**Declaring functions that need info**

- Give the function parameter within it;s code block which act as variabels

- make note of what you the function will need to complete the task

**Call the function needing info**

- specify the values that are to be used within within the parenthesis

- there are argument values and argument variables. 

*functions can return information of a single value/what is left of the resul of a calculation that was called for*
example: var area

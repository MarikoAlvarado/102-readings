### Building Blocks

- HTML automates each *element* as being within it's own box.

- The box = block-level box **OR** inline box

- If a block-level element is *within* another block-level element. The outer becomes the **containing** or **parent** element.

### Control Positions of Elements

- **normal flow** *static*

- **positioning** or **float**

- **relative positioning** *offset properties* to move from where it would have been in *normal flow*

- **absolute positioning** *the box* will not affect elements

- **fixed positioning** *specific* elements can be fixed on the page so they do not move.

**z-index** can be used to keep elements from overlapping

get *side by side elements* using **float**

keep *elements clear/with space* between one another using **float-left,float-right** etc

### multi-column layout

use **width, float** and **margin**

### Fixed Width Layouts and Liquid Layouts

- **fixed** will not change size as browser window size changes

- **liquid** will stretch and shrink to fit as browser window size changes

**grid layout examples** on **pages 389-390**

**stay organized by using separate style sheets to group similar types of styling using *@import* or *a link*. the last rule will take precedence**

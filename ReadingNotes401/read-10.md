# Event Driven Applications

**1.Why is access control important?**
It regulates access to information according to user roles and needs in order to fulfill tasks. It minimizes risk of sensitive data getting into the wrong hands.

**2.Describe an application that would need access control.**
An example would be a bank. Only certain employees should have access to information that includes clients sensitive information such as account numbers and balances.

**3.What is a role used for?**
A role is used for assigning permissions based on tasks and needs.

**4.Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**
MAC is based more on security levels while RBAC allows permissions specific to each user..?[source](https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/role-based-access-control-rbac/)

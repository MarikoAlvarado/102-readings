  [src](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-ui-frameworks/)
2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

A library is only used when and where you call for it while a framework inverts the control of the program allowing less control over the code for the creator.[src](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/)

**Rendering** - Gathering data to load to a template it associated with and sending it as an output on the client side.[src](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16518951/rendering-in-context-of-web-development)

**Templates** - A structure/pattern for writing code

**State** - A state is a point of event amongst other events within an application.

    1. Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
    2. Build A Static Version in React
    3. Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State
    4. Identify Where Your State Should Live
    5. Add Inverse Data Flow

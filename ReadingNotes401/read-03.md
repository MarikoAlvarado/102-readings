**1. Name 3 real world use cases where youâ€™d want to change the request with custom middleware.**

Adding the time or date that a request was made. Validating information before it reaches the server for example, checking to see if a username exists or if a phone number consists of numbers vs letters.

**2. True or false: The route handler is middleware**

False, the route handler can force a request to run through middleware before proceeding though.

**3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works**

I really want to understand more about how tests work.

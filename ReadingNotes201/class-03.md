# Duckett HTML book: Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)

## Lists   &lt;&gt;

### Ordered Lists

- Using &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;li&gt; lists will be indented and numbered automatically.

### Unordered Lists

- Use &lt;ul&gt; to create an undorder list with &lt;li&gt; in between it the 
&lt;ul&gt; open and closing. list will be indented with bullet points, unless otherwise specified. These lists can also be "nested" within one another. See page 68.

### Definition Lists

- &lt;d1&gt; will not indent and will serve as the item which will be followed by a list of terms and definitions.

- &lt;dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt; can be used in between &lt;d1&gt; bracketts to contain terms and defintions.

# Duckett HTML book: Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

## Dimensions of Boxes

- use **width** and **height**

- Or limit those features using **min-width** and **max-width** to allow flexibility in the display of boxes in accordance to user screen size.

- The same can be done with height using **min-height** and **max-height**

- If content within box is too big **overflow** can be used to control whether extra content can be **hidden** or shown by scrolling to using **scroll**.

## Borders of Boxes, Margins and Padding

- Boxes have a border *even if they cannot be seen*. The **border** is what separates one box from another.

- The **margin** is what brings space or the "gap" between each border of each box.

- **Padding** is like the cushion between the text or content *within* a box and the border of the box which it sits in.

The *appearance* of boxes such as,

- **border width**
- **border styles**
- **border radius**
- **border colors**
- **padding margin**
- **position of the content within**
can be modified in CSS as well. **Refer to pages 311-322.**

# Duckett JS book: Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

## if.. else Statements

**if/else** is used to check a condition and will result in either *true* or *false*

## Switch Statements

**switch** statements start with *switch value*. If the variable of a code ending in **break;**, matches the *switch value* in each code, they will continue to run in order. If non of them do then a *specified* **default** value will run.

## For and While loops

Loops continue to run until returned false. **for loops** uses a counter as a condition. There are three types of **for loops**:

**for** code runs for specific number of times it is told

**while** loops continuously as long as condition is *true*

**do-while** runs at least once even if condition is *false*

# Domain Modeling

A domain model describes the different entities, attributes and behaviors and what limits there are over the problem domain.
**entities** stores information in properties and the expected behaviors aka **object-oriented**

a good domain model can easily check and validate how it is understood by various developers/teams.

**constructor function** to find same properties amongst various objects

When building a Domain Model

- build various objects with *attribute* and *behaviors*

- use **constructor function** which defines and intitializes given properties

- creat small methods which model one part of the functions job

- use **new** followed by a **call** to constructor function

- store new objects into **variables** to access *properties* and *methods* from **outside**

- use **this** variable inside of methods to access *properties* and *methods* from **inside**

Duckett HTML: Chapter 6: "Tables" (pp.126-145)

### Creating Tables

start with **< table >**

follow with *row* using **< tr >**

inside of row use **< td >** different cells *or* **< th >** if header of cell

**rowspan** = more than one row 

**colspan** = more than one column

split longer tables with **< thead >, < tbody > or < tfoot >**

# Duckett JS: Chapter 3: "Functions, Methods, and Objects"(pp.106-144)

### Functions

Group sets of statements that work together in representing single task. Using this, parameters can be taken and used in order to return a value

### Objects

Objects contain properties and values to represent a real world example. when a function is used in an object it is then known as a *method*

- objects *represent* what is loaded on a web page as well as the documents *inside* of it.

**built in methods** with properties that help you write script ex:

- String

- Number

- Math

- Date

**arrays** and **objects** can create complex sets of date *and* can contain one another in either order.

# [EJS Partials](https://medium.com/@henslejoseph/ejs-partials-f6f102cb7433)

**Partials** are useful for using the same HTML for *more* than one **view**. You can define a chunk of code and reuse it wherever it's needed. 

1. create a `.ejs` file within the **views/partials** directory

2. the file created can be used for specific section of a page that you want to use across multiple views. For example a footer that doesn't need changes.

3. after defining the partial, you can use it in whichever .ejs files necessary.

4. don't forget to use **strawberries** in these files

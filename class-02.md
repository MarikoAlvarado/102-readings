# Duckett: HTML&CSS CH10:Introducing CSS

## What's CSS?

CSS allows creators to control how a webpage will appear in accordance with the HTML wireframe. Contents within HTML become categorized within "boxes". CSS *properties* and *values* dictate the appearance or **style** of HTML elements. CSS can be used with HTML externally, yet connected by an insterted *>link<* withing the HTML code. **OR** CSS styles can be included directly *within* HTML code using the **<style>** element.
**It is most common for CSS rules to be made in a separate document rather than within HTML**

There are different types of CSS selectors which allow you to direct *specific* rules at *specific elements* in HTML. For example, a rule for just one of two images within the *same section* of a webpage.

**Declarations** are made up by both element properties and the *value* of properties to be changed.

## Duckett: HTML&CSS CH11:Color

### Color and its importance

- every color we see on the devices we use are made up by different mixes of red, blue and green or **RGB**

- Individual pixels in our screens can be a different color

#### Values

- *RGB* values are values expressed by number for the amount of how much red, green and blue are used

- *Hex codes* express RGB values by hexadecimal code

- *Color names* express colors simply by naming them

- *Hue* , *saturation* and *brightness* are how much gray, black and shade are present of a color
